        Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from among yourselves;
        grievous to him is your suffering; [he is] full of concern for you, and
        full of compassion and mercy towards the believers." (Quran, 9:128)
        Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, is not just a historical figure,
        but a beacon of light that continues to guide and inspire millions of
        hearts across the globe. His life and teachings have left an indelible
        mark on human history, shaping the course of civilizations and offering
        a timeless message of compassion, justice, and faith. At a time when
        ignorance and darkness prevailed, Prophet Muhammad emerged as a herald
        of truth and enlightenment. Born in the city of Mecca in the year 570
        CE, his early life was marked by moral integrity and an unwavering sense
        of justice. Even before his prophethood, he earned the title of
        "Al-Amin" (the trustworthy) for his honesty and reliability
